	<h3>Theology</h3>
	<p>After several years in undergrad reading and writing on medieval mystical theology, I arrived at the University of Virginia to do a Ph.D. in philosophical theology. After taking a class on the theology of Karl Barth, my plans to study apophatic theology in dialogue with contemporary continental philosophy were derailed and I turned to modern Protestant dogmatic theology. Finding a particular interest in figures like Pannenberg and JÃ¼ngel, I have spent the last few years digging deeply in post-Barthian Protestant theology. I am now writing my dissertation on vulnerability in Protestant dogmatics, defending a rich concept of vulnerability as central to understanding Christologically the identity of God and the identity of the human. </p>
	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>At the same time, I've become interested in the past few years in how technology impacts teaching, and how teachers can engage new and interesting applications to enrich their teaching. I spent three years as the Teaching + Technology Support Partner (TTSP) for the Department of Religious Studies at U.Va. As TTSP, I helped faculty and graduate students learn to use and incorporate technologies such as WordPress, NowComment, and wikis into their teaching practice. Continuing my own interest in use of digital tools in the humanities, I applied for and became a Praxis Fellow in the Scholars' Lab at U.Va. Part of a group of six humanities graduate students, I am learning central skills in digital humanities, and, at the same time, learning what it means to be a digital humanist.</p>
